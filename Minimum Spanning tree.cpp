// Time Complexity: O(E*logE) + O(E*logE)~ O(E*logE), where E = no. of given edges.
  //The maximum size of the priority queue can be E so after at most E iterations the priority queue will be empty and the loop will end. Inside the loop, there is a pop operation that will take logE time. 
//This will result in the first O(E*logE) time complexity. Now, inside that loop, for every node, we need to traverse all its adjacent nodes where the number of nodes can be at most E. 
//If we find any node unvisited, we will perform a push operation and for that, we need a logE time complexity. So this will result in the second O(E*logE). 

//Space Complexity: O(E) + O(V), where E = no. of edges and V = no. of vertices. O(E) occurs due to the size of the priority queue and O(V) due to the visited array. If we wish to get the mst, we need an extra O(V-1) space to store the edges of the most.
