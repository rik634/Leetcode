## Problem statement
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
- Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
  - Choosing any integer x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.
  - Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.
  - Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

- Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

### Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int n) {

        if (n == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return n % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```
- Time complexity: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(1)
