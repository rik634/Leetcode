- Table: World

<img width="297" height="238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13959833-cecd-490a-9889-705eb091787b" />

name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.

- A country is big if:
- it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
- it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
- Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.
- Return the result table in any order.

### Solution
```mysql
SELECT
    name, population, area
FROM
    world
WHERE
    area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000
;
```
